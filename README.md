# Odin-recipes
This is my first project with Odin, it is intended to utilize all the html experience that I have acquired up till this point. I'm excited to work on a project, finally!
I'm making a recipe website of a dish I enjoy, Zuppa Toscana. It was my favorite soup @ Olive Garden, before I worked in fine dining.
